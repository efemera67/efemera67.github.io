                </summary>

                <h3>What Is Mad Pride?</h3>
                <p data-location-exclude>Mad Pride celebrates the human rights and spectacular culture of people considered very different by our society. It is a mass movement of the users of mental health services, former users, and the aligned, which advocates that individuals with "mental illness" should be proud of their Mad identity. Mad Pride challenges prevailing narratives that pathologize mental health experiences, seeking to redefine them as valid and valuable. It asserts the rights of individuals with lived experience to define their own experiences and narratives.</p>
                <p data-location-exclude>Mad Pride may be celebrated any time but is most often observed in the month of July, usually on or around July 14, Bastille Day. 2011 marked the 30th anniversary of psychiatric survivors using Bastille Day to celebrate Mad Pride.</p>
                <p data-location-exclude>The tradition of using Bastille Day as Mad Pride Day was started in New York by the Mental Patients Liberation Alliance and has since spread around the world. The 14th of July marks the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille in Paris, France in 1789. For over the past two centuries, the storming of the Bastille has been a universal symbol of liberation. In addition, when the Bastille was stormed, two prisoners with psychiatric labels being detained therefor that reason were freed.</p>
                <p data-location-exclude>The Mad Pride celebrations have grown directly out of an historic but little-known international social change movement led by psychiatric survivors that began in about 1970.</p>
                <p data-location-exclude>The month of July is shared with Disability Pride, so we celebrate both Disability and Madness in intercommunal solidarity.</p>
                
                <h3>Who Is Mad Pride For? Is It Only For Psychiatric Survivors?</h3>
                <p data-location-exclude>This movement is open to all, whether or not you have personally been labeled by the psychiatric system. Mad Pride celebrates how each person's eccentricities, passion, uniqueness and freedom makes you truly human. Do not allow our very humanity to be pathologized by a corporate mental health system that has gone out of control! Celebrate your Mad Pride!</p>
                
                <h3>Is Using The Word "Mad" Stigmatizing?</h3>
                <p data-location-exclude>The term "mad" has historically been used as a pejorative and derogatory term to stigmatise and marginalise individuals with mental health conditions or disabilities.</p>
                <p data-location-exclude>However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement to reclaim and redefine the word "mad" as a means of empowerment, advocacy, and challenging societal norms!</p>
                <p data-location-exclude>It is now framed as a social and political identity by people who have been labeled as mentally ill or as having mental health issues.</p>
                
                <h3>How Can I Support Mad Pride?</h3>

                <h3>What Is Sanism?</h3>
                <p data-location-exclude>Sanism refers to the systemic discrimination against or oppression of individuals perceived to have a mental disorder or cognitive impairment. This discrimination and oppression are based on numerous factors such as stereotypes about neurodiversity.</p>
