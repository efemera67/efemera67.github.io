<p>What the world needs is a collectively constructed antithesis of the common westerner. A new archetype superceding the old.</p>
<p>I have pushed for so long to integrate myself with this society that I had completely forgotten who I really am, and I don't know a better word to describe that experience than colonization.</p>
<p>Nobody is coming to save us so we must save ourselves.</p>
<p>Imperial life is life for the obedient and death for the disobedient, life for the convenient and death for the inconvenient.</p>
<p>"I came close to you, and the day dawned on me, and now it dawns on you too.... [S]he approaches, glowing; her love for the earth approaches. All solar love is innocence and creative longing. Look there: how she approaches impatiently over the sea. Do you not feel the thirst and the hot breath of her love? She would suck at the sea and drink its depth into her heights; and the sea’s desire rises toward her with a thousand breasts. It wants to be kissed and sucked by the thirst of the sun; it wants to become air and height and a footpath of light and light itself. Verily, like the sun I love life and all deep seas. And this is what perceptive knowledge means to me: all that is deep shall rise up to my heights."</p>
<p>Everything that matters in life is determined by the perspective we choose to inhabit in our present moment. Mastering life is managing perspectives around changing moments. Failure to adapt to an adequate perspective for the existing moment is a loss in the potential of life.</p>
<p>"Life wants to build itself up into the heights with pillars and steps; it wants to look into vast distances and out toward stirring beauties: therefore it requires height. And because it requires height, it requires steps and contradiction among the steps and the climbers. Life wants to climb and to overcome itself climbing."</p>
<p>"The life of the spirit and the life of the body are aspects of a single life.... [L]ife uses the spirit against its present form to attain a higher perfection."</p>
<p>It is periodically necessary to take myself down so that a greater myself can come up.</p>
<p>"The swiftest horse that will carry you to perfection is suffering. Nothing is as bitter as suffering, and nothing as sweet as having suffered."</p>
<p>Tie yourself to the world you don't know because it might leave your morning behind.</p>
<p>In the end, the revolutionary subject is always one who faces a direct and immediate threat from the system itself, who is consciously aware of it and who chooses to fight for their life and against their annihilation. Everyone else is either a sympathizer or an accomplice — to the revolutionary or to the system itself.</p>
<p>"Finally, every Palestinian (in the broad sense, meaning anyone who sees Palestine as a part of their struggle, regardless of their secondary identities), every Palestinian is on the front lines of the battle for Palestine, so be careful not to fail in your duty."</p>
<p>"Today's wars are no longer just wars and clashes between armies but rather are struggles between societies. Let us be like a solid structure and play a game of biting fingers with the enemy, our society against their society."</p>
<p>Solidarity to the point of visceral self-identification: in the end, this is the only solidarity that will matter. Do you feel the collective pain of the colonized people of the Earth? Do you feel our pain? In the end, this is the only division, the only left versus right, that will matter.</p>
<p>When we are truly alive, life always demands more from us. The only choice will be to accept it.</p>
<p>Worship the sun, the moon, the stars, the cosmos, the struggle. Worship nature like it is supernatural. Love it unconditionally as one must love life.</p>
<p>I have to practice near-perfect discipline all day every day just to make it out alive. How about yourself?</p>
<p>It doesn't matter how many times I try to abandon my website, what I am realizing is that it is a necessary component of my partially-conscious strategy for survival.</p>
<p>Today I am especially thankful for the Nicaraguan woman who saved my life eight years ago, and it is a reminder that some of the greatest role models are the most humble, invisible people on Earth.</p>
<p>"It is to the advantage of despots to keep people ignorant; it is to our advantage to make them intelligent. We must lead all of them gradually away from ignorance."</p>
<p>Pride is the opposite of shame.</p>
<p>I may have a irreconcileable worldview with almost all of the people that surround me, but I choose to assert myself because I choose to live and to be strong. I refuse marginalization, invisibilization, and social death. I choose humanity and I choose love.</p>
<p>To touch the sky with your hands, you must move heaven and earth.</p>
<p>To reveal the madness of our present moment, you only need one screen viewing unspeakable genocidal atrocities committed with international impunity and approval, and another screen viewing the serene walled gardens of the oblivious people who indirectly benefit from them.</p>
<p>Will you stand to strive for a favorable future or will you continue to consume a cherry-picked past?</p>
<p>Fear is a test, a rite of passage, a pilgrimage. Every victory over fear is an ascent on the ladder of existence.</p>
<p>The anti-intellectual society is more than the absence of difficult thinking: it actively makes thinking difficult or even punishes it, turning it into an act of rebellion.</p>
<p>Supreme parenthood is the potential within all of us to understand reality, take responsibility for it, transform it, give birth to a new world and guide its development until it finally becomes old.</p>
<p>The key difference between an activist and a revolutionary is that the activist has a choice but the revolutionary does not.</p>
<p>To become revolutionary is to exhaust all other options until the only alternative option is death.</p>
<p>"I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions in Einsteins's brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops."</p>
<p>The global system which sustains our livelihoods is the same system which exterminates our most vulnerable neighbors, and it is called the Fourth Reich.</p>
<p>In this era of humanity, your place in the global social hierarchy is principally determined by where you are born and who your parents were at the time of your birth.</p>
<p>If you have the luck of being able to ignore the conflicts out there, know that one day soon they will come to you.</p>
<p>Striving forever to be physically and mentally active and athletic.</p>
<p>Transformation is life. Evolution is beauty.</p>
<p>The first step to giving yourself a direction in life is to describe it in words.</p>
<p>We may appear to be equals, but our social scales are imbalanced.</p>
<p>To the western civilian: I will be coming for everything that you possess.</p>
<p>Can you even think in your own native language?</p>
<p>I am what I am because I do not have a choice, but with the small degree of freedom I have, I strive to become the best version of it.</p>
<p>If I can't convince you as a friend then I will haunt you as an adversary.</p>
<p>Oh, we are all complicit, in all of it, oh yes.</p>
<p>The end of our way of life is near.</p>
<p>Become loyal to the global south.</p>
<p>Whose blood fuels your livelihood? Who suffers for your privileges? Which humans will the machine sacrifice next?</p>
<p>Happiness and pleasure are not requirements for a life well lived.</p>
<p>Severe mental or physical stress can negatively transform the body in such a way that only massage can negate this transformation.</p>
<p>You can live in any imaginary world you create for yourself if reality does not interfere too strongly.</p>
<p>Meaning and purpose are derived from the world we inherit.</p>
<p>Try not to fill your mind with garbage.</p>
